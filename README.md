# Pascal Case For Usual Texts
<p>Have you ever heard of the Camel case? Camel case and Pascal case both are the same naming convention. If you don’t know pascal case means capitalizing the first alphabet of every word of your text. E.g. This Is A Example Of A Text Using Pascal Case.</p>
<p>It’s a very common standard for programming languages but this project is not for naming your variable! It’s for usual texts we use in our daily life which has space (”  “) in between words!</p>
<p>Now that you know what this project does, probably you are thinking this project is very silly. But if you are dealing with a huge chunk of data and have to use this naming convention for each word, that can be a huge pain!</p>
<p>I made this project while I was working on a work project, which required populating data on a web database and needed to use this naming convention for more than 300+ pages! So why not solve a real-life problem with the automation skill I have! The surprising thing is only because of these few lines of code, I completed the project on time.</p>
