Built a side project to get help with contaminated Sites Registry project at office. This project has a real life office application. It can format (e.g. Hamilton Beach) any unformatted text (e.g. hAMiLTon BeacH). Usually it works with all type of inputs including numbers and non-alphabetical characters but make sure there is only one space between two words.
